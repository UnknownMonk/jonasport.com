          As I said before my name is Jonas Walden and I am a full stack web
          developer. Reading over your poster I tick a lot of these boxes and
          the ones I don't tick I feel confidante that I can learn quickly. I am
          a laid back guy that likes to joke around but most importantly I can
          code.If you look through my Github you will find 130 + repos and a lot
          of green squares because I code every day and have more that 2 years
          of experience with professional web design and development. I have
          several project on my portfolio site that are all unique,built from
          scratch projects and my LinkedIn page you will find references that
          have been given to me from people I have worked with in the past. I
          don't have any Glamour shots so I attached a picture of me wrestling a
          bear. You know because, Merica! Also it just so happens that I do know
          the answer to life, the universe and everything? I have thought long
          and hard about this and the answer is 42 üòÅ.
